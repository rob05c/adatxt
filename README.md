In-Progress Ada Text Editor.

I wanted to learn Ada, so I started writing a text editor.

So far, it's an unoptimised pair of dynamic arrays and a cursor position (similar to how Emacs stores buffer text), a bit of terminal control code, and not much more.

# Building

The general build commands are in `build.sh`.

It doesn't currently use any libraries, so install Ada normally.
